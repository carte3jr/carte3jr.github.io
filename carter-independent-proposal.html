		<p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Portfolio Site Redesign – Jacob Carter</p>
		
		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Last semester in SMAD 307, I built a portfolio site for myself that featured all of the music I’ve worked on to date embedded in the home page, as well as samples of the work I’ve done in SMAD. I was excited to try this out, and I had a lot of fun with the assignment, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t have a ton of ideas that I either didn’t know how to implement, or simply ran out of time to pursue.</p>
		
		<p>For my independent project proposal, I’d like to revamp my portfolio site into a fully-fledged music player, prioritizing the act of listening as opposed to scrolling and reading. I envision a song tracker that indicates information such as; song title, album title, song length, and song position. Additionally, I’d like to create some sort of visualizer to loop in the background as music plays. Ideally, I want to implement these concepts through the use of Bootstrap. Whether or not I still include my other work in the fields of design and writing is still up for debate, as I don’t want to overload the site with information that is spread out and unrelated.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Goals:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a song tracker that displays important song information</li>
				<li>Create an audio visualizer to serve as a background while music is playing</li>
				<li>Learn the foundations of Bootstrap to implement my design ideas</li>
				<li>Avoid overloading the site with information that isn’t relevant to what users are there for</li>
			</ul></strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br>
		(Personas)
		</p>
			<ol><strong>1. Potential Employers</strong><br>
				<p>After reading through my application, a potential employer at a software development company follows a link on my resume to my portfolio site, as he is interested in my sound design capabilities. He expects a succinct presentation of my work, and is delightfully surprised to find an easy and accessible audio player that provides a glimpse into what I do in the world of sound.</p><br>
			<strong>2. Music Enthusiasts</strong><br>
				<p>After finding and enjoying my Spotify page, a fan clicks a link to my website in search of more content. What they are greeted with is an experience that conventional streaming services don’t provide: a smoothly-designed audio player featuring an audio visualizer. With one click of a button, the user can sit back and let the audio player do its thing, while the visualizer serves as a fitting backdrop. Additionally, the user can find works of mine that aren’t released anywhere else, such as soundtrack pieces and unreleased demos.</p>
